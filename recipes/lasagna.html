      <h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
      <p>Lasagna is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough.</p>
      <p>In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and similarly small amounts of "besciamella" or béchamel sauce in an oven dish.</p>

      <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>(32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>32 ounces cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>½ cup water </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            
            <li>Warm a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Mix together cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
            
            <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
