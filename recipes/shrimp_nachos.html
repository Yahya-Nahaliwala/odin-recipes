      <h1>Shrimp Nachos</h1>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>You can make it days ahead of time and have it out of the oven in just a few minutes when you need it. Add more chipotle peppers if you like it spicier. This recipe makes a lot, but it actually freezes well. I usually freeze half of it and have it another time. If you're making it for a party, though, bring it all because it will be gone! </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) package tortilla chips, or to taste </li>
            <li>2 pounds shredded Monterey Jack cheese </li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds large peeled and deveined cooked shrimp, tails removed and shrimp quartered </li>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise </li>
            <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped </li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro </li>
            <li>¼ cup dried minced onion (such as McCormick® Coarse Grind Blend White and Green Onions) </li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            
            <li>Spread tortilla chips onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li>Mix Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp, mayonnaise, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, cilantro, minced onion, cumin, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spoon mixture onto the tortilla chips.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil nachos until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Allow nachos to sit at room temperature for about 2 minutes before serving.</li>
            
      </ol>
