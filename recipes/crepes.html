      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> A crêpe or crepe is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes originated in Brittany, a region in western France, during the 13th century,and are now consumed around the world. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: <em>sweet crêpes</em> (<em>crêpes sucrées</em>) or <em>savoury galettes (crêpes salées)</em>. They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as jam or hazelnut cocoa spread. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette. </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot, with whipped cream.</li>
            
      </ol>
